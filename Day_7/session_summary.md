The document you provided, "Generative & Agentic AI - 22 July -", contains notes from a meeting on July 30, 2025.

Here's a summary of the content:

  * **Simple Language Model:** The meeting began with a review of building a simple language model that predicts the next word with 98% accuracy. It was explained how text preprocessing, tokenization, and input/output sequences with one-hot encoding are used. The model generates words one by one, similar to GPT, by predicting the next most probable word and appending it to the input for continuous generation.
  * **Limitations:** A key limitation of this simple model is its tendency to "forget" information when dealing with large-scale data, making it unsuitable for the vast datasets used by models like GPT. This is because sequential learning can lead to confusion and information loss when the number of possible next words increases significantly.
  * **Introduction to Transformer Model:** The Transformer model was introduced as a solution for large-scale sequential and language data, revolutionizing generative AI since its introduction around 2017. Based on the "Attention All You Need" research paper, it significantly enhanced generation processes and led to the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs). An LLM is defined as a model trained on vast amounts of text data.
  * **Transformer Functionality:** The Transformer is an AI model designed for understanding and generating human languages by reading, comprehending, and producing text. It uses "attention" to prioritize important words and understand their relationships within a sequence.
  * **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** The core architecture of the Transformer consists of an encoder (for deep analysis of input) and a decoder (for generating output sequences), often used for tasks like translation. Both components receive respective language data to learn.
  * **Encoder Block Details:** The encoder block includes input embedding, positional encoding (crucial for understanding word order as Transformers process all words simultaneously), multi-head self-attention, add and normalization layers, and a feed-forward network.
  * **Decoder Block Details and Masked Attention:** The decoder block also uses output embedding and positional encoding. A key feature is "masked multi-head self-attention," which ensures the decoder predicts the next word only based on previously generated words to prevent "cheating." It also includes add and normalization layers, encoder-decoder attention, and a feed-forward network.
  * **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Self-attention helps the machine learn word relationships by identifying important words in a given context.
  * **Softmax Activation Function:** Softmax is used in the final output stage to scale values between 0 and 1, converting them into probabilities for each neuron's output, allowing the decoder to select the most likely next word.
  * **Transformer Architecture Summary:** The five main components are: tokenization and embedding, positional encoding, the encoder, the decoder, and the final output layer. The Transformer reads input, understands meaning using attention, and generates smart output word by word.
