The provided document, summarizes a session from July 23, 2025.

Here's a breakdown of the key topics and discussions:

**Previous Session Review:**

  * AI Council briefly covered the use of the Transformers library for text generation and GPT-2 models, noting that the generated outputs were sometimes slow and nonsensical, which will be addressed later in the course.

**Tokenization and Text Encoding:**

  * AI Council introduced tokenization as the process of splitting sentences into smaller units called tokens.

**Generating Multiple Outputs and Agentic Systems:**

  * Jyoti Rajput asked about determining the most precise output when generating multiple outputs from a transformer.
  * AI Council explained that manual analysis is currently needed, but future sessions will cover advanced methods using multiple "agents" to compare and refine outputs.
  * They also noted that advanced LLMs like GPT-4 or Gemini Flash 2.5 are required for such multi-LLM applications.

**Bag of Words (BoW) Representation:**

  * AI Council explained BoW as a method to convert text into numerical form for machine learning, illustrating it with examples of converting sentences into a numerical matrix.
  * They demonstrated implementing BoW in Python using `CountVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`, highlighting that it ignores "stop words" to reduce data size.
  * **Limitations of BoW:** AI Council discussed that BoW loses semantic understanding and word order, struggles with out-of-vocabulary words, and can create high-dimensional data for large documents.

**Introduction to TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):**

  * To address BoW's limitations, TF-IDF was introduced as a more advanced technique. It assigns lower numerical values to common words and higher values to unique words to help machine learning algorithms focus on significant terms.
  * **Mathematical Formulas for TF-IDF:** AI Council explained TF (measures word frequency in a document) and IDF (measures term importance across all documents). They also mentioned an improvisation (1+n in the denominator) to prevent zero values for word importance.
  * **Calculation Examples:** Examples were provided to show how word frequency influences TF-IDF values (e.g., common words like "AI" get lower values, while less common words like "future" and "data" get higher values).
  * **Python Implementation of TF-IDF:** AI Council guided attendees through implementing TF-IDF using `TfidfVectorizer` from `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`, showing how data is fitted and transformed into a numerical matrix.
  * **Limitations of TF-IDF and Introduction to Word Embeddings:** TF-IDF lacks semantic understanding, ignores word order and grammar, and doesn't capture contextual awareness. AI Council then introduced word embeddings as a more advanced solution for word generation tasks and for capturing semantic relationships, recommending attendees research integer embedding and word vectors for the next session.

**GitHub Repository Access and Management:**

  * AI Council explained how to access and manage shared files on GitHub, advising attendees to create an account and fork the repository to ensure continued access.
