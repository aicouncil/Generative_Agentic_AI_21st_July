### 1\. Introduction to the AI Generator App

The `text_generator.py` file demonstrates a simple yet powerful web application built with the **Streamlit** library that allows a user to generate text using two different large language models (LLMs): **GPT** (from OpenAI) and **Gemini** (from Google). This app serves as a practical example of creating a single user interface to access multiple generative AI services for a common task.

### 2\. Application Setup and UI

The script uses Streamlit to create the web application's interface.

  * **Library Imports and API Configuration:** The script imports `streamlit` for the UI, and `openai` and `google.generativeai` to interact with the respective LLMs. It then initializes client objects for both APIs, with placeholders for the API keys.
    ```python
    import streamlit as st
    import openai
    import google.generativeai as genai

    client = openai.OpenAI(api_key = "")
    genai.configure(api_key= "")
    ```
  * **UI Components:** The app's layout is constructed using various Streamlit functions.
      * `st.title()` and `st.markdown()`: Display the main title and a subtitle for the application.
      * `st.text_area()`: Creates a multi-line text input box where users can enter their prompt.
      * `st.radio()`: Presents a radio button to choose between "GPT (OpenAI)" and "Gemini (Google)". This is a crucial component for enabling model selection.
      * `st.button()`: Creates a button labeled "Generate...." that, when clicked, triggers the text generation process.
    <!-- end list -->
    ```python
    st.title("AI Generator App")
    st.markdown("**Generate text using Gemini or GPT**")
    prompt = st.text_area("Enter your prompt..")
    model_choice = st.radio("Choose a model" , ("GPT (OpenAI)" , "Gemini (Google)"))
    ```

### 3\. Text Generation Logic

The script's core functionality is encapsulated within a conditional block that executes only when the "Generate...." button is clicked.

  * **Triggering Generation:** The `if st.button("Generate...."):` statement acts as the trigger for the text generation process.
  * **User Feedback:** The `with st.spinner("Generating...."):` block is used to display a spinning animation, providing visual feedback to the user that a task is in progress.
  * **GPT (OpenAI) Generation:**
      * The code checks if the user selected "GPT (OpenAI)". If so, it prepares the prompt in a message format required by the OpenAI API (a dictionary with `role` and `content`).
      * It then calls the `client.responses.create()` method, specifying the model as `"gpt-4.1-nano"` and the `input` as the prepared message.
      * The generated response is displayed using `st.success()` and `st.write()`.
    <!-- end list -->
    ```python
    if model_choice == "GPT (OpenAI)":
        message = [{"role" : "user" , "content" : prompt}]
        response = client.responses.create(
            model = "gpt-4.1-nano",
            input = message
        )
        st.success("Response generated by GPT-")
        st.write(response.output_text)
    ```
  * **Gemini (Google) Generation:**
      * The `else` block handles the case where "Gemini (Google)" is selected.
      * It initializes a `genai.GenerativeModel` object for the `'gemini-2.5-flash'` model.
      * It calls the `model.generate_content(prompt)` method, passing the user's prompt directly.
      * The response is then displayed using `st.success()` and `st.write()`.
    <!-- end list -->
    ```python
    else:
        model = genai.GenerativeModel('models/gemini-2.5-flash')
        response = model.generate_content(prompt)
        st.success("Response generated by Gemini-")
        st.write(response.text)
    ```

### 4\. Overall Concepts and Details

  * **Use Cases:** This app is a great example of a simple, multi-LLM text generation tool. It can be used for:
      * **Content Creation:** Quickly generating ideas, drafts, or different versions of text.
      * **Educational Demos:** Showcasing the capabilities of different LLMs.
      * **Rapid Prototyping:** Testing which model is better suited for a specific text generation task.
  * **Benefits:** The app provides a unified interface for comparing the output of two powerful generative models. Streamlit's simplicity allows for the creation of a functional web app with very little code.
  * **Limitations:** The application requires valid API keys to function, which must be handled securely. It is a simple, stateless application and does not support multi-turn conversations or advanced model-specific parameters for fine-tuning the output.
